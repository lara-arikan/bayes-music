This program makes algorithmic music using a Bayesian network. The user is prompted to specify nodes for the network tier by tier, creating a tree where the nodes in one tier can be conditionally dependent on a maximum of two nodes, which must both belong to the preceding tier. For simplicity, there can be a maximum of four tiers. The probabilities for the parent nodes in the very first tier are specified by the user, as are the conditional probabilities for each descendant node on the binary states of its parents. The program then generates a given number of samples from the Bayesian network created. If a node has state 0 in the sample, no note is appended for it. If it has state 1, it will have a volume that decreases as a function of its distance from the first tier, and a frequency that is a weighted average of the frequencies of its parents. If a parent has state 0, its weight in the average will be lower than if it has state 1. The notes are appended to a stream in the order in which their associated nodes were first specified. A short rest is appended to the stream in between samples to distinguish their individual contributions to the music. When all the samples have been processed, the result is saved as a .midi file, which can be listened to using any digital instrument. 

For clarity, the program also graphs the Bayesian network.
